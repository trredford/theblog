          <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>Hi my name is Tara. I'm a mom based in San Francisco. I have a beautiful
                8 year old daughter named Camila. We love to explore the city and find the funnest and safest playgrounds around the city. Our main stomping grounds is the Pacific Heights neighborhood, due to it's close proximity to my daughters school. Safety and fun are our top prioties when exploring playgrounds, but other qualities increase or decreese our ratings of the parks we go to.
